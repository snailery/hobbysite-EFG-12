## Some Group Conventions
Please work in your branches. 
* Use `git status` to check which branch you are on.
* Use `git checkout [yourname]/[yourapp]` to switch to the correct branch.

Pull before push!
* Use `git pull` to update your local branch!
* Use `git push origin [yourname]/[yourapp]` only after staging and committing all changes.

Commits must be atomic.
* I lost marks to this one for the lab. - Adara
    * Means you have to commit after small changes, don't commit all at once.
* Use `git add .` to stage all changes or `git add file1.py file2.py` to stage only specific files.
* Use `git commit -m [your message]` to write your commit message.

#### NEVER PUSH TO MAIN !!
* Always make sure you're doing `git push origin [yourname]/[yourapp]` to push to your branch instead of main.
* If you want to merge, submit a pull request instead!
    * if there's ever any conflicts, let's arrange a group meeting to discuss it :^)
